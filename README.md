# Download Images from Network to Windows Pictures Directory with Flutter 2.2

![picsum screenshot](docs/screenshot_picsum.png)

Code for the tutorial on downloading images from the network and saving images
to the pictures directory of Windows 10.  You do not need the RICOH THETA to
complete the tuturial.  I first show how to download the images from a free
network site before connecting to the RICOH THETA.  The code to download the images
from the RICOH THETA or other network source is isolated into a separate class method.
It is easy to switch between code for the Lorem Picsum free image site and
the RICOH THETA.
